# PathFinder 

PathFinder: Your personalized 4-year college journey planner, tailored for success at Rutgers University.

PathFinder is a comprehensive tool designed to guide Rutgers University students in planning their academic journey. The app allows users to input their major, school, career aspirations, and preferences, and combines this with detailed course and degree requirement data to generate a customized 4-year academic plan. By leveraging the power of the Gemini AI API, PathFinder analyzes the userâ€™s inputs, alongside Rutgers-specific data such as course offerings, SAS Core requirements, and specific major requirements, to recommend an optimized schedule that balances workload, difficulty, and academic goals. The app not only ensures that students meet all graduation requirements, but it also aligns their course selection with future career paths and personal learning preferences. The result is a dynamic, personalized plan that sets students on the path to success throughout their time at Rutgers University.
